# Postage - a web based email client

This isn't usable yet. It doesn't even send or receive anything.

Currently fleshing out a UI and building up the groundworks.

A few aims:
* Usable with email or other messaging platforms. Perhaps using Matrix. Or a mix of both
* No concept of "folders". Everything is a combination of labels
* Offline support
* Multiple users
* Built in calander + todo lists


If somebody does want to run it:

* `cd server`
* `yarn`
* `node index.js`

In a different terminal:
* `yarn`
* `yarn run dev`
